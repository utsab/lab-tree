#Mindset and Habits

After working with dozens of students, I've found a few major traits which separates the students who succeed from the students who don't.  At their core, these successful traits boil down to a set of mental habits. 


## Release 0: Fixed vs. Growth Mindset

The most powerful mental habit is having a "growth" mindset.  

Read this [article on the difference between a growth vs. fixed mindset](https://blog.bufferapp.com/the-habits-of-successful-people-they-have-a-growth-mindset).  


Exercise: Sometimes we may have a growth mindset towards certain aspects of ourselves, but a fixed mindset towards other aspects.  Reflect on what aspects of yourself you have a growth mindset towards and what aspects you might have a fixed mindset towards. (Spend at most 10-15 minutes on this) 


## Release 1: Mindfulness/Self-awareness

I've found that the smartest people tend to be the ones who are able to expose their ignorance.  They're able to answer questions with, "I don't know.".  One prerequisite for exposing your ignorance is mindfulness and self-awareness.  Read through the following resources on the power of mindfulness and meditation.

- [How Mindfulness can improve productivity, focus, and work life balance](http://www.productivityninja.co.uk/getting-things-done-and-the-mindful-productivity-ninja/)



## Release 2: Learning how to learn

Another habit that great learners have is that they experiment with their own learning process to find what works best for them.  

Research the topic of productivity using the following (or other) resources as your starting point. 'Sprawl' by searching for more resources related to the topics below.

Cover as much ground as quickly as you can, getting an idea of the borders around the subject without charting every square inch. You want to understand the scope of this challenge before you dig into a particular sub-set.

It's easy to get carried away with research, so limit yourself to an hour for this challenge.

After you've gotten a glimpse of the lay of the land, go back and spend more time with anything that sounded interesting. You should have a decent idea about what is out there, so now you can explore the areas that really interest you.

## Release 3: Reflect

Reflecting is essential for solidifying your learning. You will be expected to complete a reflection for each challenge during the 2-week trial period. It will help you learn how you learn and help me gauge your progress.  For this challenge, reflect on which topics seemed the most relevant to you.  Which topics took you furthest out of your comfort zone?  Are there any habits you can see yourself implementing in the next 2 weeks?
