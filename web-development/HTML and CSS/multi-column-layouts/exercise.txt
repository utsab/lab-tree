Find a website with a multi-column layout.  Explain the strategy they use to build their layout.  Is it fluid or fixed?  How do they create the gutters?  How do they add padding around the content.

This site used a multi column layout, combined with box-sizing: border-box; to place some pictures on the page. Elements on the page are both fluid (links/input at the top) while the pictures are fixed (using a min/max width property to determine if a picture will show up on the page). Gutters are created using the padding property.






What is a situation where you would want to employ a max-width property on a column?  min-width?  

When designing a fluid webpage that allows for easy viewing on a number of different screen sizes. Setting the max (and min) width properties can be extremely helpful in deciding what elements will end up where.
