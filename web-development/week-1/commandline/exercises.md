# Command Line Exercises


* What is "bash"?  What is shell?  (Hint: Read [this](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/learning-the-bash/0596009658/ch01.html)) for a quick history lesson on bash)

* What strategy will you use to learn/practice the commands? 

* What is the difference between "../ " and "./" (Hint: try them out in your terminal if you're not sure)

* Do you remember what the following commands do off the top of your head?
 -pwd
 -cd
 -help
 -exit
 -mv 
 -touch 
 -mkdir 
 -echo 


* Use the man pages to find one "option" that looks interesting/useful to you for each of the following commands.  Write an explanation of what the command/option does. 
-ls 
-grep 
-find
-less 
-rmdir 
-cat 
-rm  

* Clone this repository onto your desktop.  How would you search for all the exercises? (Hint: all exercises contain the word "Exercises")

* You may have noticed that a problem with the above approach is that other non-exercise files may also contain the word "Exercises".  An even better approach would be to search based on file name, since all exercises are named "exercises.md".  How would you search for all files that are  named "exercises.md"?


* How would you search for all files that have an extension of ".md"?
